I would like to set up a quick meeting to discuss this and come to an agreement on the changes made to the site. I am available at the following times to meet:

Wednesday 9:00 AM EST - 12:00 PM EST, 2:00 PM EST - 6:00 PM EST
Thursday 9:00 AM EST - 12:00 PM EST, 1:00 PM EST - 6:00 PM EST
Friday 9:00 AM EST - 12:00 PM EST, 1:00 PM EST - 6:00 PM EST

Let me know if any of these times do not work, and we can figure out a time next week.


Thank you!
